# Proof Pack

proofpack is a $\LaTeX$ package to typeset natural deduction proofs (in mostly a Fitch-style way). It is most similar to fitch.sty by Johan W. Klawer (June 10, 2001) and edited by Alexander W. Kocurek (June 8, 2019). It deviates from this package in several ways, but notably it allows for simpler input. The simpler input makes it more attractive to those new to $\LaTeX$ and for students learning logic.

## Installation

Download the proofpack.sty file to the directory where you keep your $\LaTeX$ packages. You can then use the package by adding the following line to the preamble of your $\LaTeX$ document:

\usepackage{proofpack}

## Usage

See [proofpack.pdf](https://github.com/davidagler/proofpack/blob/main/proofpack.pdf) for documenation and usage.
