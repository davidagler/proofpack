# Proof Pack

proofpack is a LaTeX package to typeset natural deduction proofs (in mostly a Fitch-style way). It is most similar to fitch.sty by Johan W. Klawer (June 10, 2001) and edited by Alexander W. Kocurek (June 8, 2019). It deviates from this package in several ways, but notably it allows for simpler input. The simpler input makes it more attractive to those new to LaTeX and for students learning logic.

Documentation for proofpack is available in the proofpack.pdf file.

## Installation

Installation is easy. Simply download the proofpack.zip file and unzip it. Then move the files to the appropriate directories. In particular, you want to drag the proofpack.sty file to the directory where you keep your LaTeX packages. You can then use the package by adding the following line to the preamble of your LaTeX document:

\usepackage{proofpack}

## Usage

See documentation for usage.
